# C-programming
#Class Projects and Practice

As the title suggests this repo is a documentation of class assignments and personal practice as I learn C programming.
I'd like to say, I really like C and I dare say it's more enjoyable than Javascript.
If you have a question do reach out, I'm always up for a challenge.
